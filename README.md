# BPG - Block Puzzle Game

Just a fun project I made during learning C++ with SDL and modern language constructions. Most interesting was to reuse uint16 for storing object matrix, lets say "efficient memory utilization" :)
I call it Block Puzzle Game but technically everyone sees by which game it was inspired from.
